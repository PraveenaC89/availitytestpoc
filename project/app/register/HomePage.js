      <p>
        Gemma is a middle grade novel that follows a curious explorer and her ring-tailed lemur, Milo, as they hunt for
        the “most greatest treasure in the world”. Solving riddles, battling a bell-wearing jaguar, and traveling the
        Eight Seas, Gemma’s adventures take her from a young girl to a brave captain, whose only limits are the stars.
